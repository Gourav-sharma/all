A plugin to help in all type development in flutter.

## Getting Started

This project includes several services and extensions to enhance the Flutter development experience:

- **Context Service**: Provides a global context throughout the application, allowing for easy access and manipulation of context-dependent properties and methods.

- **Size Extensions**: Offers extensions for all size-related properties, including `sp`, `sw`, `w`, and `h`. These extensions facilitate responsive design by scaling text, button sizes, and screen dimensions based on the device's screen size.

- **Navigation Service**: Simplifies navigation between pages using a consistent API, making it straightforward to manage routing in the application.

- **Snackbar and Custom Dialog**: Provides utility methods to show snackbars and custom dialogs from anywhere in the app, improving the user interaction experience.
